Did someone just ask you to update a 40 year old FORTRAN 77 program?
If so, then you may be in the right place. Here you will find several
small, but complete, FORTRAN 77 programs illustrating many common
language concepts and constructs. The intent is to give programmers
with no FORTRAN 77 experience a core set of fundamental examples to
help them get up to speed quickly on this venerable language. If you
really want to become an expert FORTRAN 77 programmer, then the best
way is to look at quality code -- check out the BLAS and LAPACK for a
start. 

You can read a bit more about these examples on my [home page](https://www.mitchr.me/SS/exampleCode/F77.html).

Have fun!
