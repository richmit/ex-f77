       program statf

C      The one line STATEMENT function.  They are local to the unit
C      they are defined in.  They must be one line.  You declare them
C      just as you do variables.

       real avg4
       real a, b, c, d

       AVG4(a, b, c, d) = (a+b+c+d)/4
       write (*,*) 'avg(1,2,3,4)=', AVG4(1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0)

       end
